# Food Order System using Linked List and C++

## Overview
This project implements a simple food order system using the concepts of linked lists in C++. The system allows users to place food orders, modify orders, and view the current order list. 

## Features
- **Order Placement:** Users can place orders for various food items.
- **Order Modification:** Users can modify existing orders (e.g., add more items, remove items).
- **Order Listing:** Users can view the list of current orders.
- **Data Structure:** The system is implemented using a linked list data structure to manage the orders efficiently.
